Things for the Expert Sleepers Disting NT eurorack module.

### polyGen
- This is a port of our open-source VCV Rack module of the same name.
- It's primary function is to draw a CV manipulatable polygon on an oscilloscope via selectable X & Y outputs.
- It can also sound pretty gnarly through some analog distortion 'n stuff.
- Selectable V/Octave input is available for musical use.
- All of the same parameters from the original module are available.
- The output from the NT is nearly identical to the original VCV module side by side, when using the NT as a USB audio interface
